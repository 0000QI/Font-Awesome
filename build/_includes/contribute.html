  <h2 class="page-header">Requesting New Icons</h2>
  <p>
    New icons mostly start as requests by the
    <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/issues">Font Awesome community on GitHub</a>. Want to request a new
    icon? Here are some things to keep in mind:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Please be nice. Font Awesome is a happy place.</li>
    <li>Please <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/search?type=Issues">search</a> to see if your icon request already exists.</li>
    <li>
      Please and thank you if you include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Title your <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:%20icon-name">new issue</a>
          <code>Icon request: icon-name</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Include a few use cases for your requested icon. How do you plan on using it?</li>
        <li>Attach a single color image or two that represent the idea you're going for.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Concrete objects make good icons, since abstract concepts are, well, abstract. It's harder to make an icon
      to represent happiness. It's easier to make a smiley face. <i class="icon-smile"></i>
    </li>
  </ol>

    Found a bug? Want to request a new icon? Want to see what's up next for the project?
    <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/issues">Submit an issue</a> or a
    <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/pulls">pull request</a> on the
    <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}">GitHub project</a>. Here are a few guidelines:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Be nice. No one likes a jackass.</li>
    <li>Check to see if your issue you want to open already exists. Search is a beautiful invention. <i class="icon-smile"></i></li>
    <li>
      If you're making a request for a new icon, it's helpful if you include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Title your request <code>Icon request: icon-name</code></li>
        <li>Icon use cases. How do you want to be using it?</li>
        <li>Attach an image or two that represent the idea you're going for. Remember that font icons are a single color.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're submitting a pull request, make it on the latest -wip branch. All pull requests against master will be
      ignored.
    </li>
  </ol>
