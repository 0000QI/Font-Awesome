    Found a bug? Want to request a new icon? Want to see what's up next for the project?
    <a href="{{ site.font-awesome.github.url }}/issues">Submit an issue</a> on the
    <a href="{{ site.font-awesome.github.url }}">GitHub project</a>. Here are a few guidelines:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Be nice. No one likes a jackass.</li>
    <li>Check to see if your issue you want to open already exists. Search is a beautiful invention. <i class="icon-smile"></i></li>
    <li>
      If you're making a request for a new icon, it's helpful if you include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Title your request <code>Icon request: icon-name</code></li>
        <li>Icon use cases. How do you want to be using it?</li>
        <li>Attach an image or two that represent the idea you're going for. Remember that font icons are a single color.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
