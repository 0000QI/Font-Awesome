<h4><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Warning!</h4>
For some reason, Adblock Plus has chosen to automatically remove many Font Awesome brand icons with their "Remove Social
Media Buttons" feature. We will not use hacks to force them to display. Please
<a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/bugs" class="alert-link">report an issue with Adblock</a> if you believe this to be an error. To work
around this, you'll need to modify the social icon class names.
