<div id="requesting-new-icons">
  <h2 class="page-header">Requesting New Icons</h2>
  <p>
    New icons mostly start as requests by the
    <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/issues">Font Awesome community on GitHub</a>. Want to request a new
    icon? Here are some things to keep in mind:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Please be nice. Font Awesome is a happy place.</li>
    <li>Please <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/search?type=Issues">search</a> to see if your icon request already exists.</li>
    <li>
      Please and thank you if you include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Title your <a href="{{ site.font_awesome.github.url }}/issues/new?title=Icon%20Request:%20icon-name">new issue</a>
          <code>Icon request: icon-name</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Include a few use cases for your requested icon. How do you plan on using it?</li>
        <li>Attach a single color image or two that represent the idea you're going for.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Concrete objects make good icons, since abstract concepts are, well, abstract. It's harder to make an icon
      to represent happiness. It's easier to make a smiley face. <i class="icon-smile"></i>
    </li>

    Hopefully you think Font Awesome <em>is</em> awesome. I've put hundreds of hours into the project to give back to the
